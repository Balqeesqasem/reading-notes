### LOCAL STORAGE

- Cookies:
 Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

 * Cookies are included with every HTTP request

1.  slowing down your web application
2. thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet 


History :
- userData(allows web pages to store up to 64 KB of data per domain)
- Flash cookies (it allows Flash objects to store up to 100 KB of data per domain)
