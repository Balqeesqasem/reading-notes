# CSS

 Each CSS rule contains two parts: 

 1. selector (which element the rule applies to).
 2. declaration (how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.)


 We have 3 way to style :

 1. External CSS .
 2. Internal CSS.
 3. Inline CSS.

 Selectors allow you to target rules to specific elements in HTML document.

 *CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page, it's better and more professional to write it external.
