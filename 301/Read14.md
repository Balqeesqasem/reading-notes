# Database Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

- By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.

reasons to normalize a database:
1. minimize duplicate data
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. simplify queries

- Duplicated information presents two problems: 
    1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
    2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
