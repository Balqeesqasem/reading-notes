# flex-grow
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

# flex-wrap
change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

# flex-shrink
This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

# flex-basis 
This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. 

# align-content
