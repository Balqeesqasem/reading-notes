# Node.js
   * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
   * Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

    - event-based.
    - non-blocking.
    - asynchronous I/O runtime.

    * Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server.


    - Node’s execution model :
    
       1. Node apps pass async tasks to the event loop , along with a callback .
       2. The event loop efficiently manages a thread pool and executes tasks efficiently .
       3. executes each callback as tasks complete.


     - Advantages :
        1. speed 
        2. scalability
        3. your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier).
