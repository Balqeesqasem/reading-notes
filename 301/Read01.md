# Responsive
 
  Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

  Responsive web design is broken down into three main components:

  *  flexible layouts : is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width 

  *  media queries 
  *  flexible media

  #### Using the flexible grid formula we can take all of the fixed units of length and turn them into relative units.


  ## Media Queries 

  Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.

  * Mobile First: One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

  * Viewport:  It's a meta tag.
