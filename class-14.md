##### Transforms :
- new ways to position and alter elements. 
- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.


##### 2D Transforms:
- Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. 
- The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.

##### Transitions & Animations:

1. Transitions:
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

2. Animations:
Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.
